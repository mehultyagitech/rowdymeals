                        Our policy lasts 20 mins prior the order has been recived to you. If 20 mins have gone by since
                        your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.<br>
                        To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you
                        received it. It must also be in the original packaging.<br>
                        To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.<br>
                        Any food item will not be return if it is intentionally spoiled by customer.<br>

                        Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have

                        If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be
                        applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of working

                        If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.
                        Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially
                        posted.<br>
                        Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
                        If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at
